			<h3> DESCRIPTION </h3>

		Skip the restaurant and make your own copycat Chipotle Chicken recipe at home. The marinade is quick, easy, healthy, and tastes even better than the real thing!
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For ingredients, you'll need:
			<ul>
				<li>6oz chicken breast or chicken thighs</li>
				<li>1 can of chipotles in adobo sauce</li>
				<li>1/4 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
				<li>3/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
				<li>3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3>
				<ol>
					<li> Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Combine the garlic and chipotle in adobo sauce in a bowl. Rub the spice mixture evenly over the chicken and let them sit for a 5 minutes. </li>
					<li> Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Grease the grill grates with oil and cook on each side for six to eight minutes. </li>
					<li> Use a thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken is at or above 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Once this temperature is reached, remove chicken from heat. </li>
					<li> Once cooked, transfer the meat to a plate and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. This step prevents the juices from running out of the chicken. </li>
				</ol>
